# Different approaches to defining router and handler

- `default` is a plain function way and is more preferable.
- `dsl` is DSL (domain specific language) - less code footprint.
- `like_django` follows Django pattern in terms of url handling
- `like_expressjs` is using anonymous handler (more on that: [anon_handler](anon_handler))
